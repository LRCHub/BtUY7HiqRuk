[00:18.09] You used to get it in your fishnets
[00:22.54] Now you only get it in your night dress
[00:24.69] Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
[00:25.97] Landed in a very common crisis
[00:40.97] 
[00:26.78] Everything's in order in a black hole
[00:27.48] Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
[00:28.40] That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
[00:30.13] Remember when you used to be a rascal?
[00:49.13] 
[00:33.48] Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
[00:37.77] The best you ever had is just a memory
[00:42.96] And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
[00:45.51] Aren't as daft as they seem, my love
[00:47.24] When you dream them up
[00:58.24] 
[00:51.32] Flicking through a little book of sex tips
[00:54.77] Remember when the boys were all electric?
[00:57.01] Now when she's told she's gonna get it
[00:59.25] I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
[01:21.75] 
[01:01.48] Clinging 'til I'm getting sentimental
[01:03.43] Said she wasn't going, but she went still
[01:05.79] Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
[01:08.25] Was it a Mecca Dauber or a betting pencil?
[01:29.25] 
[01:09.77] Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
[01:14.01] The best you ever had is just a memory
[01:20.18] And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
[01:24.37] Aren't as daft as they seem, my love
[01:27.69] When you dream them up
[01:38.69] 
[01:29.01] Oh, Flo
[01:30.30] Where did you go?
[01:33.32] Where did you go?
[01:38.09] Where did you go, oh?
[01:48.59] 
[01:54.46] You're falling about
[01:57.82] You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
[02:02.53] Just sounding it out
[02:05.85] But you're not coming back again
[02:21.85] 
[02:12.10] You're falling about
[02:16.61] You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
[02:20.54] You were just sounding it out
[02:25.11] But you're not coming back again
[02:41.11] 
[02:28.94] You used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
[02:32.22] Now you only get it in your night dress
[02:33.67] Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
[02:37.11] Landed in a very common crisis
[02:52.11] 
[02:40.83] Everything's in order in a black hole (you were just sounding it out)
[02:42.22] Is anything as pretty in the past, though?
[02:44.23] That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco (you're not coming back again)
[02:46.01] Remember when you used to be a rascal, oh?
